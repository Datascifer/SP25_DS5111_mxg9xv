# Project Name

Welcome to our project! This repository demonstrates a simple Python application with automated testing using GitHub Actions. The setup is designed to be beginner-friendly while still covering key technical details.

## Overview

This project uses GitHub Actions to automate the build and test processes. Every time you push code or trigger the workflow manually, the project is built and tested on both Python 3.10 and 3.11. We also include basic tests to verify the operating system and Python version, ensuring consistency in our development environment.

## Features

- **Automated Workflows:** GitHub Actions runs tests on each push or manual trigger.
- **Python Version Matrix:** Tests are executed with both Python 3.10 and 3.11.
- **Environment Validation:** Built-in tests check that the OS is Linux and that the correct Python version is in use.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Basic knowledge of Git and command line usage.
- Python 3.10 or 3.11 installed.
- GitHub account for accessing the repository and workflow logs.

### Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**
   
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repository.git
   cd your-repository
   ``` 
2. **Create and Activate a Virtual Environment** 
 
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv env
   ```

   Activate the environment:

   ```bash
   source env/bin/activate
   ```  

3. **Install Dependencies**
   
   Install all required dependencies using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```  

4. **Run Tests Locally**
   
   To verify that everything is set up correctly, run the test suite:

   ```bash
   pytest -vvx tests
   ```  

## GitHub Actions Workflow  

The workflow configuration is located in `.github/workflows/validations.yml`. It automatically builds the project and runs tests on every push. You can check the progress and logs of these runs under the **Actions** tab in your repository on GitHub.
