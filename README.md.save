# LAB-05: Setting up Your Tests to Run in GitHub Actions

In this lab, you'll use GitHub Actions to run the test automation we created using pytest, pylint, and a Makefile. The goal is to have a GitHub Workflow that runs your tests on demand. Follow the steps below to set up a basic workflow, and feel free to enhance it as you become more comfortable.

## Quick Workflow Setup

### Part 1: Running Your Linter and Tests

1. **Create Workflow Directory:**  
   Create a directory named `.github/workflows` in your repository. This is where GitHub looks for workflow files.

2. **Create the Workflow File:**  
   Create a file named `validations.yml` inside that directory and add the following content:

   ```yaml
   name: Feature Validation

   on:
     push:
     workflow_dispatch:

   jobs:
     build:
       runs-on: ubuntu-latest
       strategy:
         matrix:
           python-version: ["3.10"]

       steps:
         - uses: actions/checkout@v4
         - name: Set up Python ${{ matrix.python-version }}
           uses: actions/setup-python@v4
           with:
             python-version: ${{ matrix.python-version }}
         - name: Install dependencies
           run: |
             make update
         - name: Test with pytest
           run: |
             make test
